# Timeline-Standard
Metadata standard for timelines.

We borrow from perio.do, SKOS, and schema.org/event to build a schema for timeline events. We define two objects:

## TimelineEvent Object
An occurrence in a sequence, which is usually temporal. It might be a point or a range.

## Timeline Object
A collection of TimelineEvent objects
